# Family Tree App - Project Charter

## Project Overview

### Project Name
Family Tree Web Application

### Project Sponsor
Daniel Schmidt

### Project Manager
TBD

### Date
January 2024

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation
Families struggle to maintain comprehensive records of their genealogical history due to:
- Scattered information across multiple sources and formats
- Lack of accessible, user-friendly tools for family tree management
- Difficulty in collaborating with family members on genealogical research
- Limited options for sharing family history with future generations
- Complex existing solutions that are either too expensive or too technical

### Impact
Without proper family history documentation:
- Valuable genealogical information is lost over time
- Family connections and relationships become unclear
- Cultural heritage and family stories are not preserved
- Collaborative research efforts are inefficient and fragmented

---

## Project Purpose and Justification

### Business Case
The Family Tree App addresses the growing need for accessible genealogical tools by providing:
- A user-friendly web interface for family tree management
- Collaborative features for family member participation
- Secure data storage and backup capabilities
- Multi-language support for diverse families
- Cost-effective solution compared to commercial alternatives

### Strategic Alignment
This project aligns with the increasing digitization of personal records and the growing interest in family history research, particularly among millennials and Gen Z users.
