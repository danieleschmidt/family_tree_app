# ADR-0004: Data Import/Export Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Family tree applications need interoperability with other genealogy software and data backup capabilities. Users often have existing data in various formats (GEDCOM, CSV, other apps) and need to export their data for backup or migration purposes.

## Decision
Implement comprehensive import/export functionality supporting:

1. **GEDCOM Standard**: Primary format for genealogy data exchange
2. **CSV Format**: Simplified format for basic family data
3. **JSON Export**: Application-native format with full feature support
4. **Incremental Sync**: Update existing trees with new data
5. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation during import process

## Technical Implementation
- Create `ImportExportService` with format-specific handlers
- Add background job processing for large imports
- Implement data validation and conflict resolution
- Provide detailed import/export logs and error reporting
- Support media file handling during import/export

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Easy migration from other genealogy software
- Data portability and backup capabilities
- Standardized data exchange format support
- Reduced data entry burden for existing users

**Negative:**
- Complex data validation requirements
- GEDCOM standard compliance challenges
- Performance impact for large imports
- Data quality issues from external sources

## Alternatives Considered
- API-only integration (limited compatibility)
- Manual data entry only (user friction)
- Proprietary format only (vendor lock-in)
