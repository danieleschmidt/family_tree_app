# ADR-0003: Family Tree Visualization Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application currently has basic Plotly/Dash integration but lacks comprehensive family tree visualization. Users need interactive, navigable family trees that can handle large datasets and provide intuitive relationship visualization.

## Decision
Enhance the existing Plotly/Dash implementation with:

1. **Interactive Tree Layouts**: Multiple layout options (traditional tree, circular, compact)
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Lazy loading for large family trees with 1000+ people
3. **Navigation Controls**: Zoom, pan, focus on individual, generation filtering
4. **Person Cards**: Hover/click details with photos and key information
5. **Relationship Highlighting**: Visual connection emphasis when selecting individuals

## Technical Implementation
- Extend `dash_apps/family_tree.py` with advanced Plotly features
- Implement JavaScript callbacks for interactivity
- Add layout algorithms (hierarchical, force-directed, circular)
- Create responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Integrate with backend APIs for real-time data

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rich, interactive user experience
- Scalable visualization for large families
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Real-time updates and collaboration support

**Negative:**
- Increased frontend complexity
- Performance considerations for large datasets
- Browser compatibility requirements

## Alternatives Considered
- D3.js custom implementation (more complex)
- SVG-based static trees (limited interactivity)
- Canvas-based rendering (accessibility concerns)
