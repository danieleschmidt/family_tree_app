# ADR-0001: Django Framework Choice for Family Tree Application

Date: 2024-01-01

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The family tree application requires a robust web framework that can handle user authentication, database relationships, file uploads, and multi-language support. The application needs to manage complex family relationships and provide a secure, scalable platform for multiple users.

## Decision
We have chosen Django as the primary web framework for the Family Tree application.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Built-in ORM**: Django's ORM simplifies complex family relationship modeling
- **Authentication System**: Comprehensive user management with minimal custom code
- **Admin Interface**: Ready-to-use admin panel for content management
- **Security Features**: Built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection)
- **Internationalization**: Native support for multiple languages (EN, FR, RU, ZH, ES)
- **Template System**: Powerful templating with inheritance and reusability
- **Community & Documentation**: Extensive documentation and third-party packages
- **Scalability**: Proven track record in large-scale applications

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Requires Python and Django-specific knowledge
- **Monolithic Structure**: Less flexibility compared to microservices architecture
- **Performance Overhead**: Framework abstraction may introduce latency
- **Version Dependencies**: Framework updates may require application changes

### Neutral
- **Python Ecosystem**: Access to extensive Python libraries for data processing
- **Convention over Configuration**: Structured approach may limit architectural flexibility

## Alternatives Considered

### Flask (Python)
- **Pros**: Lightweight, flexible, minimal setup
- **Cons**: Requires more boilerplate code, fewer built-in features, manual security implementation

### Node.js with Express
- **Pros**: JavaScript ecosystem, high performance for I/O operations
- **Cons**: Less suitable for complex relational data, callback complexity

### Ruby on Rails
- **Pros**: Convention over configuration, rapid development
- **Cons**: Smaller community, less suitable for complex data relationships

### ASP.NET Core
- **Pros**: Strong typing, enterprise features, Microsoft ecosystem
- **Cons**: Licensing costs, Windows-centric ecosystem

## Implementation Notes
- Use Django 4.1.6+ for latest security features
- Implement custom User model for enhanced authentication
- Utilize Django's built-in internationalization framework
- Leverage django-bootstrap4 for responsive UI components
- Follow Django best practices for project structure and security
