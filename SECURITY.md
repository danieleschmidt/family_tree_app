## Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Django's built-in authentication system
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Password hashing using PBKDF2
- Account activation via email verification
- Role-based access control for family trees

#### Data Protection
- SQL injection prevention via Django ORM
- XSS protection through template escaping
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure file upload handling
- Privacy controls for family data

#### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Environment-based configuration
- Secret management best practices
- Regular dependency updates

### Privacy Considerations

#### Personal Data
- Minimal data collection
- User consent for data processing
- Data retention policies
- Right to data export/deletion
- Family tree access controls

#### GDPR Compliance
- Lawful basis for processing
- Data subject rights implementation
- Privacy by design principles
- Data protection impact assessments
- Breach notification procedures

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security
```python
# DO: Use Django's built-in protections
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_protect

# DON'T: Disable security features
# CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False  # Never in production
```

#### Database Security
```python
# DO: Use parameterized queries via ORM
Person.objects.filter(name=user_input)

# DON'T: Raw SQL with user input
# cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM person WHERE name = '{user_input}'")
```

#### File Handling
```python
# DO: Validate file types and sizes
def validate_image(image):
    if image.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024:  # 5MB limit
        raise ValidationError("File too large")
    if not image.content_type.startswith('image/'):
        raise ValidationError("Invalid file type")

# DON'T: Trust user-provided file information
```

### For Administrators

#### Deployment Security
- Use environment variables for sensitive settings
- Enable Django's security middleware
- Configure secure headers
- Regular security updates
- Monitor for suspicious activity

#### Database Security
- Use least-privilege database accounts
- Enable connection encryption
- Regular backups with encryption
- Access logging and monitoring

### For Users

#### Account Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication (when available)
- Regular password updates
- Secure email account access
- Log out from shared devices

#### Data Privacy
- Review family tree permissions regularly
- Be cautious with sensitive family information
- Understand data sharing implications
- Report suspicious activity

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with Safety
- Static code analysis with Bandit
- SAST integration in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular security audits

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing for major releases
- Security code reviews
- Infrastructure security assessments
- Social engineering awareness

### Bug Bounty Program
*Currently under consideration for future implementation*
